# Product Access Manager - Hybrid Architecture
## Version 2.3.0 - Production Implementation

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready  
**Approach:** Hybrid "Search" Visibility + Role-Based Filtering

---

## Executive Summary

**HYBRID APPROACH:**
- **Vimergy products:** Restricted to users with `access-vimergy-user` role
- **HP/DCG products:** PUBLIC - visible to all users (even logged out)
- **WC Visibility:** "Search" (not "hidden") to allow FiboSearch indexing
- **Filtering:** Dual-layer (server-side + client-side for FiboSearch)

**Key Benefits:**
✅ FiboSearch can index products (they're searchable)  
✅ Plugin filters who can see them based on roles  
✅ HP/DCG remain public (no restrictions)  
✅ Clean ACF-based configuration  
✅ No performance impact

## Architecture Overview

```
Product Catalog Configuration:

Products WITHOUT site_catalog ACF:
└─ Public → Visible to everyone → Normal WC visibility

Products WITH site_catalog = ['HP_catalog'] or ['DCG_catalog']:
└─ PUBLIC → Visible to everyone → Normal WC visibility
   (ACF field exists but catalog is not restricted)

Products WITH site_catalog = ['Vimergy_catalog']:
├─ WC Visibility: "search" (visible in search, hidden from catalog)
├─ FiboSearch: Indexed (because visibility = "search")
├─ Plugin Filtering:
│  ├─ Logged out → HIDDEN (filtered by plugin)
│  ├─ Logged in WITHOUT access-vimergy-user → HIDDEN
│  ├─ Logged in WITH access-vimergy-user → VISIBLE
│  └─ Admin/Shop Manager → ALWAYS VISIBLE
└─ Direct URL: 404 for unauthorized users
```

## Restricted vs. Public Catalogs

### Restricted Catalogs
```php
$restricted_catalogs = array( 'Vimergy_catalog' );
```

**These catalogs require specific user roles to access.**

### Public Catalogs
```php
$public_catalogs = array( 'HP_catalog', 'DCG_catalog' );
```

**These catalogs are visible to ALL users, including logged-out visitors.**

---

## User Access Matrix

| Catalog | Logged Out | Regular User | access-vimergy-user | Admin |
|---------|------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| **No ACF** | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible |
| **HP_catalog** | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible |
| **DCG_catalog** | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible |
| **Vimergy_catalog** | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible |

## FiboSearch Integration

### Why We Need Client-Side Filtering

**Problem:** FiboSearch uses `SHORTINIT` mode for its AJAX endpoint, which bypasses WordPress plugin loading.

**Solution:** Hybrid approach with dual-layer filtering:

#### 1. Server-Side Filtering
```php
// For normal page loads (full WordPress)
add_filter( 'dgwt/wcas/tnt/search_results/suggestion/product', 'pam_filter_fibo_product', 10, 2 );

function pam_filter_fibo_product( $suggestion, $post_id ) {
    if ( ! pam_user_can_view( $post_id ) ) {
        return false; // Remove from suggestions
    }
    return $suggestion;
}
```

#### 2. Client-Side Filtering
```javascript
// For FiboSearch AJAX (SHORTINIT mode)
// pam-fibosearch-filter.js runs after FiboSearch results load
// Filters products and brands based on restricted list from server
```

**Why Both?**
- Server-side: Works for normal page loads
- Client-side: Catches FiboSearch AJAX (which bypasses server-side)
- Together: Complete coverage regardless of load mode

## Product Setup Guide

### Step 1: Set ACF Field

**For Vimergy Products:**
1. Edit product in WordPress admin
2. Scroll to "Product Access Control" (or equivalent ACF field group)
3. Set `site_catalog` = `Vimergy_catalog`
4. Update product

**For HP/DCG Products:**
- Set `site_catalog` = `HP_catalog` or `DCG_catalog`
- These remain public (no restrictions)

### Step 2: Set WooCommerce Visibility

**For Vimergy Products ONLY:**
1. Product Data → General tab
2. Find "Catalog visibility" (click "Edit" if needed)
3. Select: **"Shop and search results"** OR **"Search results only"**
   - ✅ "Search results only" is recommended (hidden from catalog, visible in search)
   - This allows FiboSearch to index them
   - Plugin filters who can see them
4. Update product

**For HP/DCG Products:**
- Use normal WC visibility (usually "Shop and search results")
- No restrictions applied

---

## WP-CLI Commands

### Find All Vimergy Products
```bash
wp post list \
  --post_type=product \
  --meta_key=site_catalog \
  --meta_value=Vimergy_catalog \
  --fields=ID,post_title
```

### Set Vimergy Products to "Search Only" Visibility
```bash
# For each Vimergy product ID:
wp post meta update <ID> _visibility search

# Remove from catalog (keep in search)
wp term-relationships create <ID> exclude-from-catalog product_visibility
```

### Reindex FiboSearch After Changes
```bash
wp eval 'do_action("dgwt/wcas/indexer/start");'
```

## Testing Checklist

### Test as Logged-Out User
- [ ] Search "vimergy" in FiboSearch → **NO results** (products hidden)
- [ ] Search "HP" in FiboSearch → **Results shown** (public catalog)
- [ ] Visit Vimergy product URL directly → **404 error**
- [ ] Visit HP product URL directly → **Product loads** (public)

### Test as User with access-vimergy-user Role
- [ ] Search "vimergy" in FiboSearch → **Results shown**
- [ ] Visit Vimergy product page → **Product loads**
- [ ] Can add Vimergy product to cart → **Success**

### Test as Admin/Shop Manager
- [ ] Search "vimergy" → **Results shown**
- [ ] See all products in admin → **All visible**
- [ ] Override applies everywhere → **Always visible**

### Test FiboSearch Right Panel
- [ ] Logged out → Search "vimergy" → **No details panel** (empty)
- [ ] Authorized user → Search "vimergy" → **Details panel shows** product info

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimized for Speed
- ✅ Direct ACF meta queries (no tag parsing)
- ✅ Minimal filter hooks (only essential ones)
- ✅ Client-side filtering only for FiboSearch (not all searches)
- ✅ Cached restricted products list via AJAX (loaded once per session)

### No N+1 Queries
- All product checks use direct ACF `get_field()` calls
- No expensive taxonomy lookups
- Admin override check is instant (`current_user_can()`)

---

## Code Organization

### Core Functions
```
pam_is_restricted_product()     → Check if product is Vimergy (restricted)
pam_get_required_roles()        → Get roles needed for product (empty for HP/DCG)
pam_user_can_view()             → Check if user can view product
pam_user_has_full_access()      → Admin override check
```

### WooCommerce Filters
```
woocommerce_product_is_visible  → Reveal restricted products to authorized
woocommerce_variation_is_visible → Handle variations
woocommerce_is_purchasable      → Control purchase ability
template_redirect               → 404 for unauthorized direct access
pre_get_posts                   → Modify archive queries
```

### FiboSearch Integration
```
Server-side:
  dgwt/wcas/tnt/search_results/suggestion/product → Filter products

Client-side:
  pam-fibosearch-filter.js → Filter AJAX results (SHORTINIT mode)
  pam_get_restricted_data (AJAX) → Provide restricted IDs/URLs to JS
```

---

## Security Model

### Fail-Safe Design
1. **Default:** Products without ACF field are public
2. **Vimergy:** Requires explicit role to view
3. **HP/DCG:** Always public (even with ACF field set)
4. **Admin Override:** Admins always see everything

### Defense in Depth
- **WooCommerce visibility:** "search" (not in catalogs)
- **Plugin filters:** Hide from unauthorized users
- **Query modification:** Exclude from archives
- **Single product protection:** 404 for direct access
- **FiboSearch dual filter:** Server + Client coverage

## Deployment Workflow

### Staging Deployment (Dev Branch)
```bash
git checkout dev
git add .
git commit -m "v2.3.0: HP/DCG public, Vimergy restricted, search visibility"
git push origin dev
# Wait for GitHub Actions
ssh -p 12872 holisticpeoplecom@35.236.219.140 "cd /www/.../public && wp cache flush"
```

### Production Deployment (Main Branch)
```bash
git checkout main
git merge dev
git tag v2.3.0
git push origin main --tags
# Manual workflow trigger required for production
```

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Restricted Catalog
```php
// In product-access-manager.php, update:
$restricted_catalogs = array( 'Vimergy_catalog', 'NewBrand_catalog' );
```

### Adding New Public Catalog
```php
// No code changes needed!
// Just set ACF site_catalog = 'NewPublic_catalog'
// It will automatically be public (not in restricted list)
```

### Debugging
```php
// Enable debug mode in product-access-manager.php:
define( 'PAM_DEBUG', true );

// Check debug.log for entries like:
// [PAM v2.3.0] Product 123 is RESTRICTED by catalog: Vimergy_catalog
// [PAM v2.3.0] Product 456 has PUBLIC catalogs only: HP_catalog, DCG_catalog
```

## Support & Documentation

**For Future AI Agents:**
- See `AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md` for comprehensive system docs
- See `SERVER-ACCESS.md` for deployment credentials
- See `SIMPLIFIED-ACF-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` for migration history

**Key Principle:**
> HP and DCG are always public. Only Vimergy is restricted. Products use "search" visibility to allow FiboSearch indexing, with plugin-based role filtering.
