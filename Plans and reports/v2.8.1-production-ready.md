# Product Access Manager v2.8.1 - Production Ready
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Production Deployment Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Product Access Manager v2.8.1 has achieved **production-ready status** with a fully optimized caching system, complete slider integration, and robust FiboSearch filtering. The plugin successfully controls product visibility across all WooCommerce display areas with zero performance impact.

---

## Current Architecture

### Core Design: ACF-Based Access Control

**Key Principle:** Products are restricted based on ACF `site_catalog` field values and user roles.

```
Product Visibility Logic:
├─ Admin/Shop Manager → See ALL products (always)
├─ Guest User → See ONLY public catalog products (HP, DCG)
├─ Authorized User → See public + their authorized catalog products
└─ Fail-Safe → If error, hide restricted products (secure default)
```

### Dynamic Catalog System

**Public Catalogs (Hardcoded):**
- `HP_catalog`
- `DCG_catalog`

**Restricted Catalogs (Auto-Detected):**
- Any `XXX_catalog` in ACF field choices
- Automatically detected from ACF configuration
- Zero code changes needed to add new catalogs

**Example:**
```php
// ACF field choices
Vimergy_catalog
Gaia_catalog
NewBrand_catalog  ← Automatically detected as restricted

// WordPress roles required
access-vimergy-user
access-gaia-user
access-newbrand-user  ← Create role, no code changes
```

## Performance Optimization: Dual Caching System

### Cache Layer 1: Per-User Blocked Products

**Purpose:** Shop pages, category pages, search results  
**Cache Key:** `pam_hidden_products_{user_id}` or `pam_hidden_products_guest`  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Storage:** WordPress transients

```php
Guest User Cache:
├─ First visit: Calculate blocked products → 50 IDs
├─ Cache SAVED → 30 minutes
└─ Subsequent visits: Cache HIT → Instant retrieval ⚡

Authorized User Cache:
├─ First visit: Calculate accessible products → 10 blocked IDs
├─ Cache SAVED → 30 minutes
└─ Subsequent visits: Cache HIT → Instant retrieval ⚡
```

### Cache Layer 2: All Restricted Products

**Purpose:** Product sliders, widgets, third-party plugins  
**Cache Key:** `pam_all_restricted_products`  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Storage:** WordPress transients  
**Shared:** Same cache for ALL non-admin users

```php
Slider Cache Flow:
├─ First slider load (any user): Calculate all restricted → 50 IDs
├─ Cache SAVED → 30 minutes
├─ Slider HTML cache: Built with filtered products
└─ All subsequent loads: PAM cache HIT + Slider cache HIT ⚡⚡
```

**Critical Decision (v2.8.0):** Sliders NEVER show restricted products, even to authorized users.

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Simplifies caching (one slider cache for all users)
- ✅ Maximum performance (no user-aware slider cache needed)
- ✅ Zero cross-user contamination risk
- ✅ Authorized users see their products on shop/search/FiboSearch (not sliders)

### Cache Invalidation

**Automatic Clearing:**
```php
Triggers:
├─ User login → Clear user's cache
├─ User logout → Clear guest cache
├─ User role change → Clear user's cache
└─ All triggers also clear shared "all restricted" cache
```

**Manual Clearing:**
```bash
wp cache flush
wp transient delete --all
```

## Integration Points

### 1. WooCommerce Main Queries

**Hook:** `pre_get_posts`  
**Method:** `post__not_in` exclusion (fast)  
**Cache:** Per-user blocked products

```php
Shop Page Query:
├─ Get cached blocked products for current user
├─ Add to post__not_in
└─ WooCommerce returns filtered results
```

### 2. Product Sliders (ShapedPlugin & Others)

**Hook:** `woocommerce_product_data_store_cpt_get_products_query`  
**Method:** Universal `wc_get_products()` filtering  
**Cache:** All restricted products (shared)

```php
Slider Query:
├─ Get cached "all restricted products"
├─ Add to post__not_in
├─ Slider gets filtered products
└─ Slider caches HTML (safe, no restricted products)
```

**Recursion Prevention:**
```php
$GLOBALS['pam_building_cache'] = true;
$products = wc_get_products([...]); // Won't trigger filter
unset( $GLOBALS['pam_building_cache'] );
```

### 3. FiboSearch Integration

**Challenge:** FiboSearch runs in `SHORTINIT` mode (minimal WordPress environment)

**Solution:** Hybrid approach
- **Server-Side:** WooCommerce visibility filters affect indexing
- **Client-Side:** JavaScript filter removes restricted products from live results

**Components:**
```
pam-fibosearch-filter.js:
├─ Fetches restricted data from AJAX endpoint
├─ Filters left panel (product items)
├─ Filters right panel (product details)
├─ Uses MutationObserver for dynamic content
└─ Debounced for performance

AJAX Endpoint:
├─ Returns restricted product IDs, URLs, brands
├─ Uses cached data (30-minute cache)
└─ Clean JSON output (output buffering)
```

**User-Specific Behavior:**
- **Admins:** No JavaScript filter loaded → See all products
- **Authorized Users:** No JavaScript filter loaded → See their products
- **Guests/Unauthorized:** JavaScript filter runs → Restricted products hidden

## Deployment Information

### Production Server
- **Host:** Kinsta
- **SSH Port:** 12872
- **User:** holisticpeoplecom
- **Server IP:** 35.236.219.140
- **Document Root:** `/www/holisticpeoplecom_349/public`

### Deployment Method
GitHub Actions automated deployment (manual trigger)

### Cache Management
```bash
# Clear WordPress cache
wp cache flush --allow-root

wp transient delete --all --allow-root

# Clear PAM-specific transients
wp transient delete pam_hidden_products_guest --allow-root
wp transient delete pam_all_restricted_products --allow-root
```

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Restricted Catalogs

**Steps:**
1. Add `NewBrand_catalog` choice to ACF `site_catalog` field
2. Create WordPress role: `access-newbrand-user`
3. Assign products to `NewBrand_catalog` in ACF
4. Assign users to `access-newbrand-user` role

**Zero code changes required!** ✅

### Monitoring

**Key Logs to Watch:**
```bash
# SSH into server
ssh -p 12872 holisticpeoplecom@35.236.219.140

# Monitor PAM logs (when debug enabled)
tail -f public/wp-content/debug.log | grep PAM

# Check cache performance
tail -f public/wp-content/debug.log | grep "cache HIT\|cache MISS"
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Products not appearing for authorized users  
**Solution:**
```bash
wp transient delete --all --allow-root
# User should log out and back in
```

**Issue:** Slider showing restricted products  
**Solution:**
```bash
wp transient delete pam_all_restricted_products --allow-root
# Clear Kinsta cache
```

**Issue:** FiboSearch showing restricted products  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear browser cache (JavaScript filter)
# Verify user doesn't have access role
# Check browser console for JavaScript errors
```

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **Zero code changes** needed to add new catalogs  
✅ **30-minute cache** duration provides optimal performance  
✅ **Dual caching system** handles all display scenarios  
✅ **Production deployment** stable and performing well  
✅ **Client-side FiboSearch filter** working correctly  
✅ **Slider integration** complete with native caching  
✅ **Security maintained** with fail-safe architecture

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Cache Warming:** Pre-build caches for common user types on deployment
2. **Object Cache:** Upgrade to Redis/Memcached for even faster cache retrieval
3. **Analytics:** Track which restricted products authorized users view most
4. **Admin Dashboard:** Widget showing cache statistics and hit rates
5. **FiboSearch Server-Side:** Investigate full plugin loading for FiboSearch (if performance allows)

---

## Conclusion

**Product Access Manager v2.8.1** is production-ready and battle-tested. The dual caching architecture provides excellent performance while maintaining security and flexibility. The system is designed for zero-maintenance catalog additions and handles all WooCommerce display scenarios correctly.

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and Stable  
**Next Review:** As needed for new features or catalogs
